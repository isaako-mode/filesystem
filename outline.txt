Name ideas: file_step_system, file_syster

This is a plan for how the file system will interact with the terminal

=======================================================================

messaging

will use indirect asymmetrical messaging: cmd will send to filesys by PID, then filesys will send back  

the file system program will always display the current state by passing back to the command line

start program:
    -display starting interface <- whatever we want!
        -this will be done by creating the interface (what data structure??) (char**??)
        -then pass this back to the command line

user inputs file system command:





In the command program
=====================
    -have a function that outputs file system outputs
